Your account’s capabilities are governed by one of three plans: the “Free” plan, the “Friends and Family” plan, or the “Business” plan. The applicable capabilities for each plan are captured in this section, but the details for each type of limitation is captured below, under “Plan Restrictions and Capabilities”.</p><ul><li><span class="bold">Free Plan:</span> If no other paid plan is chosen, then you are considered on the free plan. This plan limits you to a maximum of three boards, provides no collaboration or sharing options with other users, and restricts your storage to 10 MBs per project (excluding attachments), and 500 MBs of total storage across all of your projects.</li><li><span class="bold">Friends and Family Plan:</span> Users with this plan have no limitation on the number of boards they can use, but do have limitations on the amount of storage available to them: 50 MBs per project (excluding attachments), and 5 GBs of total storage across all of their projects. In addition, this plan enables users to take advantage of our collaboration / sharing capabilities described below. This plan costs $2.50 per member per month. You can have up to eight members on your plan, including yourself.</li><li><span class="bold">Business Plan:</span> <span style="text-decoration:underline;font-style:italic;">This plan is not available at this time.</span> Similar to the Friends and Family plan, members of this plan have no limitations on the number of boards they can use, and can also take advantage of the collaboration and sharing capabilities we provide. Storage and pricing for this plan is determined on a case-by-case basis depending on your needs. Owners of this plan can add any number of plan members at the agreed-upon price. In addition, this plan provides administrative capabilities, such as having multiple plan administrators, additional billing options, and additional tooling to help manage employee access across your projects.</li></ul><h2>Plan Restrictions and Capabilities</h2><p>The capabilities available to your membership is determined by your plan, as captured above. The details for these restrictions/capabilities are as follows:</p><ul><li><span class="bold">Board Limitations:</span> Your “board count” is determined by the number of boards you are the owner of. If the board count limitation for your plan gets reached, you will be unable to create any new boards. If the board count limitation is ever exceeded, which can happen when transitioning between plans, all boards will become read-only until you are back to within the board count limitation of your active plan.</li><li><span class="bold">Storage Limitations:</span> Your storage usage is calculated based on any boards of which you are listed as an owner. Storage limitations are calculated and applied to each individual user, not combined with other members of your plan. If a board has multiple owners, its stored data is counted towards every owner’s usage. If an individual board reaches or exceeds its limitation as determined by the owner with the largest threshold, the board becomes read-only until it is below its storage threshold. If a user exceeds their total project storage limitations, they will be unable to create any new boards, or create/modify any board content.</li><li><span class="bold">Collaboration / Sharing Capabilities:</span> If your plan provides you with collaboration and sharing capabilities, you can collaborate and share with anyone who also has this capability regardless of which plan they are on or who owns their plan. These capabilities allow you to manage permissions on your projects and boards, giving other users access to view and edit them as desired. Any changes to the board’s contents are reflected in near-real-time to all users currently connected to that board. If you ever lose this capability – likely by downgrading your plan – you will lose access to projects/boards that other users own, and other users will lose access to projects/boards that you own. If a project/board has multiple owners which include yourself, you will be the user that loses access.</li><li><span class="bold">Plan Members:</span> If your plan provides this capability, you can add additional members to your plan at any time. Your next invoice will automatically be adjusted to account for the new user(s) based on the price given in your plan. You may remove a plan member at any time, but the user will keep their plan benefits through the end of your billing cycle. Your next invoice will be adjusted to account for the removed user. Invoices are <span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">not</span> prorated, meaning they are not adjusted based on the percentage of the billing cycle your memberships were active. Also note that removing a plan member does not remove their access to any projects/boards you’ve given them access to as part of the “Collaboration / Sharing Capabilities” documented above.</li></ul><h2>Membership Duration</h2><p>All paid plans are billed monthly. A new invoice is automatically created on the same day every month based on the date of your plan’s first invoice. The first invoice is due on the day you create your plan. Your default payment method saved on file is automatically charged when this invoice becomes due. If payment fails for any reason, we will notify you via the email address we have on file to confirm the payment method’s details, and we will automatically re-try the payment in the days that follow. For the “Friends and Family” plan, there is a 7-day grace period, at which point you and all of your plan members will become subject to the “Free” plan’s limitations outlined above. For the “Business” plan, the grace period is extended to 30 days.</p><h2>Cancellation Policy</h2><p>You may cancel your plan at any time. Your active plan members will continue to have access through the end of the billing cycle, but their membership will not be renewed and you will not be charged again. At the end of the billing cycle, all members will be downgraded to the “Free” plan if they have not signed up for a different plan in the interim.</p></div></div>',1)],n=(0,i.aZ)({props:{},setup:()=>({})});var s=t(93379),l=t.n(s),c=t(7795),h=t.n(c),u=t(90569),d=t.n(u),p=t(3565),m=t.n(p),y=t(19216),f=t.n(y),b=t(44589),g=t.n(b),w=t(34244),v={};v.styleTagTransform=g(),v.setAttributes=m(),v.insert=d().bind(null,"head"),v.domAPI=h(),v.insertStyleElement=f(),l()(w.Z,v),w.Z&&w.Z.locals&&w.Z.locals;const T=(0,t(83744).Z)(n,[["render",function(e,o,t,n,s,l){return(0,i.wg)(),(0,i.iD)("div",a,r)}]])},45876:(e,o,t)=>{t.r(o),t.d(o,{default:()=>T});var i=t(66252);const a={id:"mw-web-legaldocs-termsofuse"},r=[(0,i.uE)('<div class="mw-legal-content-wrapper"><div class="mw-legal-content"><h1>Terms of Use</h1> Last Modified: February 23, 2022 <h2>Acceptance of the Terms of Use</h2><p>These terms of use are entered into by and between You and Moonwafer LLC (<span class="bold">“Company,”</span> <span class="bold">“we,”</span> or <span class="bold">“us”</span>).
